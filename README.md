## Internship Experiences

### LFX Mentorship

The Linux Foundation Mentorship (LFX) Program is a structured open source project internship where I had the opportunity to contribute to real-world, production-grade open source projects.

#### My LFX Journey

During my LFX mentorship with [Jaeger](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger), I worked on Jaeger V2, a major update that rebases all backend components on top of the OpenTelemetry Collector. My primary responsibilities included:

- Integrating storage backends (Cassandra, OpenSearch, Elasticsearch, Badger, gRPC)
- Developing comprehensive integration tests for the new backends
- Collaborating with experienced open source maintainers

You can find more details about my specific contributions and experiences in the [Jaeger section](https://github.com/akagami-harsh/Experience/blob/main/Jaeger/README.md).

#### Skills Used

- Golang
- CI/CD
- Docker
- Databases
- Microservices monitoring and tracing
- Performance testing and optimization

### Google Summer of Code

Google Summer of Code (GSoC) is Google's annual program that connects university students with open source organizations for paid software development internships. I participated in GSoC 2025 with the Kubeflow organization.

#### My GSoC Journey with Kubeflow

During my GSoC internship with [Kubeflow](https://github.com/kubeflow) (March 2025 - September 2025), I focused on enhancing the security, infrastructure, and developer experience of the Kubeflow ecosystem. My key contributions included:

**üîê Security Enhancements:**
- Designed and implemented production-grade deployment of SeaweedFS with multi-tenancy (namespace isolation) as a secure replacement for Minio
- Enhanced security by enforcing Pod Security Standards (PSS) baseline/restricted policies across all Kubeflow components including Notebooks, Katib, KServe, and Istio ingress gateway
- Implemented comprehensive security testing and validation frameworks

**üöÄ Infrastructure & CI/CD:**
- Migrated Istio images from DockerHub to Google Container Registry (GCR) for improved reliability and security
- Enhanced CI/CD workflows in the kubeflow/manifests repository with automated code quality checks
- Implemented pre-commit hooks for automated linting, formatting, and validation
- Refactored shared testing components to improve maintainability and reduce code duplication

**üîß Developer Experience:**
- Extended Kubeflow Pipelines (KFP) environment variables for better configuration management
- Improved documentation and developer onboarding processes
- Contributed to migration efforts for the kubeflow/dashboard repository
- Fixed critical issues in cluster deployment configurations

You can find detailed information about my contributions in the [Kubeflow Manifests](https://github.com/akagami-harsh/Experience/blob/main/kubeflow/manifests/README.md) and [Kubeflow Pipelines](https://github.com/akagami-harsh/Experience/blob/main/kubeflow/pipelines/README.md) sections.
