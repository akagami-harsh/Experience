## Internship Experiences

### LFX Mentorship

The Linux Foundation Mentorship (LFX) Program is a structured open source project internship where I had the opportunity to contribute to real-world, production-grade open source projects.

#### My LFX Journey

During my LFX mentorship with [Jaeger](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger), I worked on Jaeger V2, a major update that rebases all backend components on top of the OpenTelemetry Collector. My primary responsibilities included:

- Integrating storage backends (Cassandra, OpenSearch, Elasticsearch, Badger, gRPC)
- Developing comprehensive integration tests for the new backends
- Collaborating with experienced open source maintainers

You can find more details about my specific contributions and experiences in the [Jaeger section](https://github.com/akagami-harsh/Experience/blob/main/Jaeger/README.md).

#### Skills Used

- Golang
- CI/CD
- Docker
- Databases
- Microservices monitoring and tracing
- Performance testing and optimization
